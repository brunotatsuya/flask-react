# flask-react

## What is this?

This is a template project of a Flask Application serving a React App (typescript version), created with Vite, as front-end.

## How do I use this?

Just clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/brunotatsuya/flask-react.git`. You will need to run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder to install the Python dependencies. Next, walk into the `client` folder and run `npm install` and `npm run build`. This is for installing npm dependencies and generate a `dist` folder, needed by Python's backend for serving the front-end application as pages.
